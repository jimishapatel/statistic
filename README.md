In this Project We have created python program to perform statistical calculations. For each calculation we created at least one test to check for the correct value and another test to check for invalid input.
Invalid input should throw an exception with a description of the problem.


Calculations :

1. Population Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Population Standard Deviation
5. Variance of population proportion
6. Z-Score
7. Standardized score
8. Population Correlation Coefficient
9. Confidence Interval
10. Population Variance
11. P Value
12. Proportion
13. Sample Mean
14. Sample Standard Deviation
15. Variance of sample proportion
